# generator

This is a unique password generator with 5 variables. Length, upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols. After the user is prompted to select the variables, the password is displayed on the page.  

This was a good test of our ability to gather user input from prompts, our use of strings and arrays, and concatination to creat new strings. Took me a lot of time to get this to function. My first attempts kept generating secure and random passwords, but was not folling instruction from the prompts. After some research and some assistance fixing a couple lines of code that was crashing the whole project I was finally able to put together a functional password generator that follows instruction from the prompts.
